This model is then used to predict and display probable future \"false answer\" patterns in real-time within a user interface that includes controls to advance the simulation.\n","\n","The process was broken down into several subtasks:\n","\n","1.  **Modify the simulation function:** The `simulate_interactive_game` function was created/adapted to process \"false answers\" one by one, simulating real-time input and updating the Markov model incrementally.\n","2.  **Incrementally update the markov model:** The `simulate_interactive_game` function was further refined to update the Markov model in place by incrementing transition counts and re-normalizing probabilities for the affected state after each new false answer input.\n","3.  **Predict and display probable patterns:** A function (`predict_next_patterns`) was implemented to use the updated Markov model to predict the most probable next false patterns based on the last processed false answer. An HTML widget was added to the UI to display these predictions, and the `run_simulation` function was modified to call the prediction function and update the UI after each simulated step.\n","4.  **Add ui elements for simulated game control:** UI elements, specifically a \"Next Step\" button and an HTML display for the current step number, were added to provide controls for the interactive simulation.\n","5.  **Update the ui to display predictions:** A dedicated `ipywidgets.Output` widget was created to display the predicted patterns, replacing the previous HTML widget. The `predict_next_patterns` function was modified to write directly to this output widget, ensuring clear and dynamic real-time display of predictions within the UI.\n","\n","## Data Analysis Key Findings\n","\n","*   The `simulate_interactive_game` function successfully updates the Markov model incrementally with each new \"false answer\" input by updating transition counts and re-normalizing probabilities for the affected state.\n","*   The `predict_next_patterns` function can generate the most probable next \"false answer\" directions and their associated probabilities based on the current state of the Markov model and the last processed false answer.\n","*   The user interface now includes dedicated areas for displaying the current simulation step number and the real-time predicted next patterns, which are updated dynamically as the simulation progresses.\n","\n","## Insights or Next Steps\n","\n","*   The current implementation processes all input patterns sequentially within the `run_simulation` function. The \"Next Step\" button added to the UI is not yet functional. The next step should be to refactor the simulation logic to be driven by the \"Next Step\" button, allowing the user to advance the simulation step by step and observe the real-time model updates and predictions.\n","*   Consider adding a visual representation of the Markov model or the prediction probabilities (e.g., a bar chart) in the UI to provide a more intuitive understanding of the model's current state and predictions.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"28a5431f"},"source":["# Task\n","Implement an interactive simulation with step-by-step control and probability visualization based on the provided Python code."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"b11929be"},"source":["## Prepare for step-by-step simulation\n","\n","### Subtask:\n","Modify the `run_simulation` function to initialize the necessary state (Markov model, last false answer, data lists, plot, etc.) and store it in a way that can be accessed by the \"Next Step\" button's callback function.

The simulation loop was removed, and the \"Next Step\" button is enabled after initialization.\n","*   A callback function `on_next_step_button_clicked` was created and linked to the \"Next Step\" button. This function retrieves the simulation state, processes the next input pattern, updates the Markov model and cumulative win probability, appends data to the plot lists, updates the BQPlot lines mark, and refreshes the UI widgets (step number, progress bar, status text).\n","*   A BQPlot bar chart was added to the UI layout to visualize the prediction probabilities of the next direction based on the updated Markov model.\n","*   The `predict_next_patterns` function was modified to update the data of the new bar chart with the predicted directions and their probabilities.\n","*   The `on_next_step_button_clicked` and `run_simulation` functions were updated to manage and pass the bar chart's BQPlot mark, ensuring it's updated dynamically during the step-by-step simulation.\n","*   Logic was added to the `on_next_step_button_clicked` function to detect the end of the simulation when all input patterns are processed. Upon completion, the \"Next Step\" button is disabled, a final status message and cumulative win probability are displayed, and the prediction bar chart is cleared.\n","\n","### Insights or Next Steps\n","\n","*   The interactive simulation with step-by-step control and probability visualization is now functional, allowing users to observe the Markov model's learning process and prediction changes at each step.\n","*   Further development could include adding more detailed visualizations, such as the probability distribution for *all* possible next directions in the bar chart (not just the top N), or allowing the user to input their own patterns during the interactive simulation.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"09f34754","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1753274390325,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":2212,"user":{"displayName":"Mogomotsi Nare","userId":"06794775661013370713"}}},"source":["!pip freeze > requirements.txt"],"execution_count":42,"outputs":[]}]}
